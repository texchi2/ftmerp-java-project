## Introduction

### What is Apache OFBiz?

Apache OFBiz (Open For Business) is an open-source Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system built on Java. It's a comprehensive framework that provides:

- **Order Management** - Sales and purchase orders
- **Manufacturing** - Production planning and execution
- **Inventory Management** - Stock tracking and warehouse operations
- **Accounting** - General ledger, invoicing, payments
- **Human Resources** - Employee and payroll management
- **E-commerce** - Online store capabilities

### Why OFBiz is Different

Unlike traditional ERPs where you click through screens:

**OFBiz is:**
- **Service-oriented**: Operations are performed by calling services
- **Entity-based**: Data is stored in entities (think database tables, but better)
- **Event-driven**: Actions trigger other actions automatically
- **Highly customizable**: We can modify almost everything for FTM Garments

### Key Concept: Think in Terms of Entities and Services

```
Entity = Data (what you store)
Service = Logic (what you do with data)
Screen = UI (what you see)
```

**Example for Garments:**
- **Entity**: OrderHeader (stores order information)
- **Service**: createOrder (creates a new order)
- **Screen**: Order Entry Form (web page to enter order)

## Understanding the Data Model

### What is an Entity?

An **Entity** is like a database table, but with extra intelligence. It knows:
- What fields it has
- How it relates to other entities
- Validation rules

**Example: OrderHeader Entity**

```xml
<entity entity-name="OrderHeader">
    <field name="orderId" type="id"></field>              <!-- Unique ID -->
    <field name="orderTypeId" type="id"></field>          <!-- SALES or PURCHASE -->
    <field name="orderDate" type="date-time"></field>     <!-- When created -->
    <field name="statusId" type="id"></field>             <!-- Current status -->
    <field name="grandTotal" type="currency-amount"></field>
    <field name="billingPartyId" type="id"></field>       <!-- Customer -->

    <prim-key field="orderId"/>                           <!-- Primary key -->

    <relation type="many" rel-entity-name="OrderItem">   <!-- Has many items -->
        <key-map field-name="orderId"/>
    </relation>
    <relation type="one" rel-entity-name="Party" fk-name="billingPartyId">
        <key-map field-name="billingPartyId" rel-field-name="partyId"/>
    </relation>
</entity>
```

### How Entities Relate: The Order Example

```
OrderHeader (1 order)
  ├─ has many → OrderItem (products in the order)
  ├─ belongs to → Party (customer)
  └─ has many → OrderShipment (shipments)
      └─ has one → Shipment
```

**In Plain English:**
- One **OrderHeader** contains multiple **OrderItem** records (like line items on an invoice)
- Each **OrderHeader** belongs to a **Party** (customer)
- Orders can have multiple **Shipments** (partial shipments)

### Field Types You'll See Often

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `id` | Unique identifier | `SO-2025-001` |
| `id-ne` | Non-empty ID | `SALES_ORDER` |
| `date-time` | Date and time | `2025-01-15 10:30:00` |
| `currency-amount` | Money | `15000.00` |
| `fixed-point` | Decimal number | `123.45` |
| `indicator` | Yes/No (Y/N) | `Y` or `N` |
| `description` | Short text | Up to 255 chars |
| `very-long` | Long text | Unlimited |

### Finding Entity Definitions

All entity definitions are in XML files under `/applications/datamodel/entitydef/`:

```bash
cd /home/user/ftmerp-java-project/applications/datamodel/entitydef

# Search for an entity
grep -r "entity-name=\"OrderHeader\"" .

# View entity definition
less order-entitymodel.xml
```

**Pro Tip**: Use `Ctrl+F` in your text editor to search for entity names.

## Service Engine - The Heart of OFBiz

### What is a Service?

A **Service** is a piece of business logic that performs an action. Think of it as a function or method.

**Example Services:**
- `createOrder` - Creates a new sales order
- `updateInventory` - Updates stock quantity
- `shipOrder` - Ships an order to customer

### Service Anatomy

```xml
<service name="createOrder" engine="simple">
    <description>Create a sales order</description>

    <!-- What you need to provide -->
    <attribute name="orderTypeId" type="String" mode="IN" optional="false"/>
    <attribute name="productId" type="String" mode="IN"/>
    <attribute name="quantity" type="BigDecimal" mode="IN"/>

    <!-- What you get back -->
    <attribute name="orderId" type="String" mode="OUT"/>
</service>
```

**Breaking it down:**
- **name**: Service identifier
- **engine**: How it runs (simple, java, groovy, etc.)
- **attribute mode="IN"**: Input parameter (you must provide)
- **attribute mode="OUT"**: Output parameter (service returns)
- **optional="false"**: Required parameter

### Calling a Service

#### From Web UI:
1. User clicks "Create Order" button
2. Form data is submitted
3. OFBiz calls the `createOrder` service
4. Service processes data
5. Result shown to user

#### From Command Line (Webtools):

```
1. Open browser: https://localhost:8443/webtools
2. Login (admin/ofbiz)
3. Go to: Service Engine → Service List
4. Search for service name
5. Click "Schedule Job" or "Run Sync"
6. Fill in parameters
7. Submit
```

#### From Code (Groovy):

```groovy
def dispatcher = dctx.getDispatcher()

// Prepare input parameters
def serviceCtx = [
    orderTypeId: "SALES_ORDER",
    productId: "FTM-SHIRT-BLUE-M",
    quantity: 100,
    userLogin: userLogin
]

// Call service
def result = dispatcher.runSync("createOrder", serviceCtx)

// Check result
if (ServiceUtil.isSuccess(result)) {
    def orderId = result.orderId
    Debug.log("Order created: ${orderId}")
} else {
    Debug.logError("Failed: ${result.errorMessage}")
}
```

### Finding Service Definitions

Services are defined in `servicedef/` directories:

```bash
cd /home/user/ftmerp-java-project/applications

# Find all service definition files
find . -name "services*.xml" -type f

# Search for a specific service
grep -r "service name=\"createOrder\"" .

# View services in order module
less order/servicedef/services.xml
```

## Business Workflows Explained

### Workflow 1: Sales Order to Delivery

This is the complete process from when a customer orders to when they receive the goods.

#### Step-by-Step Process

```
[Customer Places Order]
         ↓
    Order Created → OrderHeader entity created
         ↓
    Order Approved → Status changes to APPROVED
         ↓
    BOM Analysis → Explode Bill of Materials
         ↓
    MRP Runs → Checks if we have materials
         ↓
    Production Run Created → WorkEffort entity created
         ↓
    Materials Issued → Inventory reduced
         ↓
    Production Tasks → Cutting, Sewing, QC, Packing
         ↓
    Finished Goods Received → Inventory increased
         ↓
    Shipment Created → Shipment entity created
         ↓
    Items Packed → ShipmentPackage entities
         ↓
    Shipped → Status changed to SHIPPED
         ↓
    [Customer Receives Goods]
```

#### The Entities Involved

| Step | Primary Entity | Status Field |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Order Creation | `OrderHeader` | `ORDER_CREATED` |
| Order Approval | `OrderHeader` | `ORDER_APPROVED` |
| Production Planning | `MrpEvent` | - |
| Production Creation | `WorkEffort` | `PRUN_CREATED` |
| Production Running | `WorkEffort` | `PRUN_RUNNING` |
| Production Complete | `WorkEffort` | `PRUN_COMPLETED` |
| Shipment Created | `Shipment` | `SHIPMENT_INPUT` |
| Shipped | `Shipment` | `SHIPMENT_SHIPPED` |
| Delivered | `Shipment` | `SHIPMENT_DELIVERED` |

#### Key Services for This Workflow

| Action | Service Name | Input | Output |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Create Order | `createOrderFromShoppingCart` | cart, party | orderId |
| Approve Order | `changeOrderStatus` | orderId, statusId | - |
| Run MRP | `executeMrp` | facilityId | mrpEvents |
| Create Production | `createProductionRun` | productId, quantity | productionRunId |
| Issue Materials | `issueInventoryItemToWorkEffort` | workEffortId, productId | - |
| Complete Task | `changeProductionRunTaskStatus` | workEffortId, statusId | - |
| Create Shipment | `createShipment` | orderId | shipmentId |
| Ship Order | `quickShipEntireOrder` | orderId, shipmentId | - |

### Understanding Bill of Materials (BOM)

**⚠️ CRITICAL CONCEPT**: The Bill of Materials is the **foundation** of all manufacturing operations in OFBiz. Without an accurate BOM, you cannot calculate costs, order materials, or plan production.

**📚 Complete BOM Guide**: For an in-depth understanding with real garment manufacturing examples, see [BOM-DEEP-DIVE.md](BOM-DEEP-DIVE.md)

#### What is a BOM?

A **Bill of Materials** (BOM) is a complete, structured list of all components, raw materials, and sub-assemblies needed to manufacture one unit of a finished product.

**Think of it as a recipe**:
- Recipe tells you ingredients for a cake
- BOM tells you materials for a garment

#### BOM in OFBiz: ProductAssoc Entity

```xml
<entity entity-name="ProductAssoc">
    <field name="productId" type="id"/>           <!-- Parent (finished good) -->
    <field name="productIdTo" type="id"/>         <!-- Component (raw material) -->
    <field name="productAssocTypeId" type="id"/>  <!-- MANUF_COMPONENT -->
    <field name="quantity" type="fixed-point"/>   <!-- Qty per parent -->
    <field name="scrapFactor" type="fixed-point"/> <!-- Waste % (1.15 = 15%) -->
    <field name="fromDate" type="date-time"/>     <!-- Version control -->
    <field name="thruDate" type="date-time"/>
</entity>
```

#### Example: Men's Casual Shirt BOM

**Finished Product**: 1 Blue Shirt (Size M)

**Components Required**:

| Component | Product ID | Qty | Unit | Scrap | Actual Qty | Reason for Scrap |
|-----------|-----------|-----|------|-------|------------|------------------|
| **Fabric** | FTM-FABRIC-COTTON-BLUE | 1.5 | m | 15% | **1.725 m** | Cutting waste, pattern |
| **Buttons** | FTM-BTN-WHITE-20MM | 6 | ea | 5% | **6.3** | Defects, damage |
| **Zipper** | FTM-ZIP-METAL-50CM | 1 | ea | 2% | **1.02** | Defects |
| **Thread** | FTM-THREAD-BLUE | 50 | m | 20% | **60 m** | Breaks, trimming, waste |
| **Label** | FTM-LABEL-CARE | 1 | ea | 3% | **1.03** | Damage |

**Why Scrap Factors Matter**:

Without scrap factors:
```
Order: 100 shirts
Fabric calculation: 100 × 1.5m = 150m ordered
Reality: 150m ÷ 1.725m actual = Only 87 shirts possible!
→ 13 shirts short! Production stops!
```

With correct scrap factors:
```
Order: 100 shirts
Fabric calculation: 100 × 1.5m × 1.15 = 172.5m ordered
Reality: Can make 100 shirts with small buffer
→ Production succeeds! ✓
```

#### Creating a BOM in OFBiz

**Method 1: Via Web UI**

```
1. Navigate to: Catalog → Product
2. Find your product: FTM-SHIRT-BLUE-M
3. Go to: Associations tab
4. Click: Create Product Association
5. Select:
   - Association Type: MANUF_COMPONENT
   - To Product: FTM-FABRIC-COTTON-BLUE
   - Quantity: 1.5
   - Scrap Factor: 1.15
   - Sequence: 10
6. Save
```

**Method 2: Via Service Call**

```groovy
def dispatcher = dctx.getDispatcher()

def bomEntry = [
    productId: "FTM-SHIRT-BLUE-M",
    productIdTo: "FTM-FABRIC-COTTON-BLUE",
    productAssocTypeId: "MANUF_COMPONENT",
    fromDate: UtilDateTime.nowTimestamp(),
    quantity: 1.5,
    scrapFactor: 1.15,
    sequenceNum: 10,
    instruction: "Cut according to shirt pattern",
    userLogin: userLogin
]

dispatcher.runSync("createBOMAssoc", bomEntry)
```

**Method 3: Via Data Load (XML)**

```xml
<!-- File: plugins/ftm-garments/data/FtmBomData.xml -->
<entity-engine-xml>
    <ProductAssoc
        productId="FTM-SHIRT-BLUE-M"
        productIdTo="FTM-FABRIC-COTTON-BLUE"
        productAssocTypeId="MANUF_COMPONENT"
        fromDate="2025-01-01 00:00:00"
        quantity="1.5"
        scrapFactor="1.15"
        sequenceNum="10"
        instruction="Cut according to shirt pattern"/>

    <ProductAssoc
        productId="FTM-SHIRT-BLUE-M"
        productIdTo="FTM-BTN-WHITE-20MM"
        productAssocTypeId="MANUF_COMPONENT"
        fromDate="2025-01-01 00:00:00"
        quantity="6"
        scrapFactor="1.05"
        sequenceNum="20"
        instruction="Attach to front placket"/>
</entity-engine-xml>
```

Load with:
```bash
./gradlew "ofbiz --load-data file=plugins/ftm-garments/data/FtmBomData.xml"
```

#### How BOM Drives the Entire Manufacturing Process

```

#### Key BOM Services

| Service | Purpose | When Used |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `createBOMAssoc` | Add component to BOM | Setting up products |
| `updateBOMAssoc` | Modify component quantity/scrap | BOM maintenance |
| `getBOMTree` | Get complete BOM hierarchy | Display BOM structure |
| `getManufacturingComponents` | Calculate all materials needed | MRP planning |
| `copyBOMAssocs` | Clone BOM to new product | Similar products |

#### Common BOM Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Mistake 1: Forgetting Small Components**

```
BOM has: Fabric, Buttons, Zipper
Missing: Thread, Labels, Packaging

Result: Production stops when packaging missing!
```

**✓ Solution**: Review complete product. Include EVERYTHING.

**❌ Mistake 2: Wrong Scrap Factor**

```
Scrap factor: 1.0 (0% waste - unrealistic!)
Reality: Always have waste in cutting, sewing, etc.

Result: Constant material shortages
```

**✓ Solution**:
- Test with pilot run (make 10 units)
- Measure actual material used
- Calculate real scrap percentage
- Add safety margin

**❌ Mistake 3: Not Using Version Control**

```
Changed zipper length from 50cm to 60cm
But didn't expire old BOM entry

Result: System uses both! Wrong calculations!
```

**✓ Solution**: Use `fromDate` and `thruDate`:

```xml
<!-- Old version - expire it -->
<ProductAssoc productId="SHIRT-001" productIdTo="ZIP-50CM"
              fromDate="2025-01-01" thruDate="2025-03-31"/>

<!-- New version -->
<ProductAssoc productId="SHIRT-001" productIdTo="ZIP-60CM"
              fromDate="2025-04-01"/>
```

#### Checking BOM in Database

```sql
-- View complete BOM for a product
SELECT
    pa.product_id AS "Finished Product",
    p1.internal_name AS "Finished Product Name",
    pa.product_id_to AS "Component",
    p2.internal_name AS "Component Name",
    pa.quantity AS "Qty per Unit",
    pa.scrap_factor AS "Scrap Factor",
    (pa.quantity * pa.scrap_factor) AS "Actual Qty Needed",
    pa.sequence_num AS "Sequence",
    pa.instruction AS "Instructions"
FROM product_assoc pa
JOIN product p1 ON pa.product_id = p1.product_id
JOIN product p2 ON pa.product_id_to = p2.product_id
WHERE pa.product_id = 'FTM-SHIRT-BLUE-M'
  AND pa.product_assoc_type_id = 'MANUF_COMPONENT'
  AND (pa.thru_date IS NULL OR pa.thru_date > CURRENT_DATE)
ORDER BY pa.sequence_num;
```

#### Multi-Level BOM (Advanced)

For complex products, you can have sub-assemblies:

```
Finished Shirt
  ├─ Shirt Body Assembly (sub-assembly)
  │   ├─ Front Panel (cut parts)
  │   ├─ Back Panel (cut parts)
  │   └─ Sleeves (cut parts)
  │
  ├─ Collar Assembly (sub-assembly)
  │   ├─ Collar Fabric
  │   └─ Interfacing
  │
  └─ Button Placket Assembly (sub-assembly)
      ├─ Placket Fabric
      └─ Buttons
```

This is useful for:
- Complex products
- Outsourced sub-assemblies
- Different production locations

#### BOM Best Practices Summary

1. **Include EVERYTHING**: From fabric to thread to packaging
2. **Accurate Scrap Factors**: Test in pilot production
3. **Version Control**: Use date ranges for changes
4. **Clear Instructions**: Add assembly notes
5. **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly BOM audits
6. **Document Changes**: Log why BOM was changed
7. **Test Before Production**: Validate BOM with small batch

## Common Operations

### Operation 1: Check Order Status

**Web UI Method:**
```
1. Navigate to: Accounting → Orders
2. Search by Order ID or Customer
3. Click order number
4. View status on order detail page
```

**Database Method:**
```sql
SELECT
    oh.order_id,
    oh.order_date,
    oh.status_id,
    s.description as status_name,
    oh.grand_total
FROM order_header oh
JOIN status_item s ON oh.status_id = s.status_id
WHERE oh.order_id = 'SO-2025-001';
```

**Command Line:**
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U ftmuser -d ftmerp

# Run query
SELECT * FROM order_header WHERE order_id = 'SO-2025-001';
```

### Operation 2: Check Inventory

**Web UI:**
```
1. Navigate to: Catalog → Inventory
2. Search by Product ID
3. View quantity on hand and available to promise
```

**Database:**
```sql
SELECT
    ii.product_id,
    p.internal_name,
    ii.facility_id,
    ii.location_seq_id,
    ii.quantity_on_hand_total,
    ii.available_to_promise_total
FROM inventory_item ii
JOIN product p ON ii.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE ii.product_id = 'FTM-SHIRT-BLUE-M'
AND ii.facility_id = 'FTM-FAC-MAIN';
```

### Operation 3: View Production Run Status

**Web UI:**
```
1. Navigate to: Manufacturing → Production Run
2. Search by Production Run ID
3. View tasks and status
```

**Database:**
```sql
SELECT
    we.work_effort_id,

    we.estimated_completion_date,
    we.actual_completion_date
FROM work_effort we
WHERE we.work_effort_type_id = 'PROD_ORDER_HEADER'
AND we.work_effort_id LIKE 'PR-%';
```

### Operation 4: Create a Sales Order (Simplified)

**Steps:**
1. Go to: Accounting → Orders → Create New Order
2. Select order type: Sales Order
3. Select customer
4. Add product line items:
   - Product ID: FTM-SHIRT-BLUE-M
   - Quantity: 100
   - Price: 30.00
5. Set shipping information
6. Submit order
7. Approve order (change status to APPROVED)

**Behind the scenes:**
- `OrderHeader` entity created
- `OrderItem` entities created for each product
- `OrderItemShipGroup` created for shipping
- Services called: `createOrderFromShoppingCart`, `storeOrder`

### Operation 5: Run MRP

**When to run:**
- Daily (automated)
- After receiving new orders
- When planning production for next week

**How to run:**
```
1. Navigate to: Manufacturing → MRP

**Example Error:**
```
Service [createOrder] missing required IN parameter [orderTypeId]
```

**Solution:**
1. Check service definition for required parameters
2. Ensure all `optional="false"` parameters are provided
3. Check parameter spelling (case-sensitive!)

**Fix:**
```groovy
// Bad
def result = dispatcher.runSync("createOrder", [
    productId: "FTM-SHIRT-BLUE-M"
])

// Good
def result = dispatcher.runSync("createOrder", [
    orderTypeId: "SALES_ORDER",  // ← Was missing
    productId: "FTM-SHIRT-BLUE-M",
    userLogin: userLogin          // ← Usually required
])
```

### Issue 2: "Entity not found"

**Problem:** Trying to access a record that doesn't exist.

**Example Error:**
```
Entity not found for primaryKey: [orderId:SO-INVALID]
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify the ID exists in database
2. Check for typos in ID
3. Ensure transaction was committed

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM order_header WHERE order_id = 'SO-INVALID';
-- Returns no rows = doesn't exist
```

### Issue 3: Order Status Won't Change

**Problem:** Trying to change order status but it fails.

**Reason:** OFBiz has status validation rules. You can't jump from `ORDER_CREATED` directly to `ORDER_COMPLETED`.

**Valid Status Flow:**
```
ORDER_CREATED
  → ORDER_APPROVED
  → ORDER_SENT
  → ORDER_COMPLETED
```

**Fix:**
Change status step by step following the allowed flow.

### Issue 4: Inventory Shows Zero But Should Have Stock

**Problem:** Inventory shows 0 even after receiving goods.

**Common Causes:**
1. Wrong facility ID
2. Wrong location
3. Transaction not committed
4. Inventory in different UOM (units of measure)

**Troubleshooting:**
```sql
-- Check all inventory for product across all facilities
SELECT
    facility_id,
    location_seq_id,
    quantity_on_hand_total,
    available_to_promise_total
FROM inventory_item
WHERE product_id = 'FTM-SHIRT-BLUE-M';

-- Check inventory history
SELECT
    effective_date,
    quantity_on_hand_diff,
    description
FROM inventory_item_detail
WHERE inventory_item_id = 'INV-001'
ORDER BY effective_date DESC;
```

### Issue 5: Production Run Not Starting

**Problem:** Created production run but tasks won't start.

**Checklist:**
1. ✓ Is production run status `PRUN_DOC_PRINTED` or `PRUN_CREATED`?
2. ✓ Are materials available?
3. ✓ Have materials been issued to the production run?
4. ✓ Are tasks in correct sequence?
5. ✓ Is facility/location configured?

**Fix:**
```
1. Change production run status to PRUN_DOC_PRINTED
2. Issue materials using issueInventoryItemToWorkEffort service
3. Change task status to PRUN_RUNNING
```

### Where to Look for Errors

#### 1. Log Files (Most Important!)

```bash
cd /home/user/ftmerp-java-project/runtime/logs

# View latest log
tail -f ofbiz.log

# Search for errors
grep -i "error" ofbiz.log | tail -20

# Search for specific service
grep "createOrder" ofbiz.log

# View specific time period
grep "2025-01-15 10:" ofbiz.log
```

**Log Entry Example:**
```
2025-01-15 10:30:45,123 |ERROR| ServiceDispatcher |
Error in Service [createOrder]:
org.apache.ofbiz.service.ServiceValidationException:
Missing required parameter: orderTypeId
```

#### 2. Web Tools Error Log

```
1. Open: https://localhost:8443/webtools
2. Go to: Logging → View Log
3. Filter by: ERROR or WARN
```

#### 3. Database Constraints

```bash
psql -U ftmuser -d ftmerp

# Check for constraint violations
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle in transaction (aborted)';
```

## Development Basics

### Creating a Custom Service

**File:** `/plugins/ftm-garments/servicedef/services.xml`

```xml
<service name="ftmCalculateGarmentCost" engine="groovy"
         location="component://ftm-garments/src/main/groovy/CalculateCost.groovy">
    <description>Calculate total cost for garment production</description>

    <attribute name="productId" type="String" mode="IN" optional="false"/>
    <attribute name="quantity" type="BigDecimal" mode="IN" optional="false"/>

    <attribute name="totalMaterialCost" type="BigDecimal" mode="OUT"/>
    <attribute name="totalLaborCost" type="BigDecimal" mode="OUT"/>
    <attribute name="totalCost" type="BigDecimal" mode="OUT"/>
</service>
```

**Implementation:** `/plugins/ftm-garments/src/main/groovy/CalculateCost.groovy`

```groovy
import org.apache.ofbiz.entity.util.EntityQuery

def productId = parameters.productId
def quantity = parameters.quantity

// Get BOM components
def bomComponents = EntityQuery.use(delegator)
    .from("ProductAssoc")
    .where("productId", productId,
           "productAssocTypeId", "MANUF_COMPONENT")
    .filterByDate()
    .queryList()

def materialCost = 0.0

// Calculate material cost
bomComponents.each { component ->
    def componentProduct = component.getRelatedOne("AssocProduct", false)
    def unitCost = componentProduct.getBigDecimal("defaultPrice") ?: 0.0
    def qtyNeeded = component.getBigDecimal("quantity") ?: 1.0
    def scrapFactor = component.getBigDecimal("scrapFactor") ?: 1.0

    materialCost += unitCost * qtyNeeded * scrapFactor * quantity
}

// Simplified labor cost (can be complex)
def laborCost = quantity * 5.00  // $5 labor per unit

def totalCost = materialCost + laborCost

// Return results
return [
    totalMaterialCost: materialCost,
    totalLaborCost: laborCost,
    totalCost: totalCost
]
```

### Creating a Custom Entity

**File:** `/plugins/ftm-garments/entitydef/entitymodel.xml`

```xml
<entity entity-name="FtmGarmentStyle" package-name="com.ftm.garments">
    <field name="styleId" type="id"></field>
    <field name="styleName" type="name"></field>
    <field name="description" type="description"></field>
    <field name="season" type="name"></field>
    <field name="year" type="numeric"></field>
    <field name="designer" type="name"></field>
    <field name="targetMarket" type="description"></field>
    <field name="fromDate" type="date-time"></field>
    <field name="thruDate" type="date-time"></field>

    <prim-key field="styleId"/>
</entity>
```

**Load Initial Data:** `/plugins/ftm-garments/data/FtmGarmentsData.xml`

```xml
<entity-engine-xml>
    <FtmGarmentStyle styleId="STYLE-CASUAL-001"
                     styleName="Casual Blue Shirt"
                     season="Spring/Summer"
                     year="2025"
                     designer="John Doe"
                     fromDate="2025-01-01 00:00:00"/>
</entity-engine-xml>
```

### Building and Deploying

```bash
cd /home/user/ftmerp-java-project

# Clean build
./gradlew cleanAll

# Build
./gradlew build

# Load your custom entity data
./gradlew "ofbiz --load-data readers=seed,seed-initial,ext,ftm-garments"

# Restart OFBiz
./gradlew ofbiz
```

## Best Practices for FTM Team

### 1. Always Check Logs First

When something doesn't work:
```bash
tail -f runtime/logs/ofbiz.log
```

### 2. Use Transactions Carefully

OFBiz services run in transactions. If one fails, all fail (rollback).

**Good:**
```groovy
// This is good - all succeeds or all fails
runService("createOrder")
runService("createShipment")
```

**Be Careful:**
```groovy
// If createShipment fails, order is still created
runService("createOrder")
// ... some other code ...
runService("createShipment")  // Might fail!
```

### 3. Test in DEV First

**Never test directly in production!**

Setup environments:
- **DEV** (rpitex): For development and testing
- **STAGE**: For user acceptance testing
- **PROD**: Live system

### 4. Backup Database Regularly

```bash
# Daily backup
pg_dump -U ftmuser -d ftmerp > ftmerp_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Keep 7 days of backups
find /backups -name "ftmerp_backup_*.sql" -mtime +7 -delete
```

### 5. Document Your Changes

When you modify FTM-specific code:
```
File: /plugins/ftm-garments/src/.../MyService.groovy
Date: 2025-01-15
Author: [Your Name]
Purpose: Calculate garment production cost
Changes: Added scrap factor calculation
```
